#' Export aligned feature table from patRoon to NeatMS
#' This function exports the aligned feature table from patRoon to a format compatible with NeatMS. It extracts the necessary information from the XCMSnExp object and the patRoon feature groups, and then combines them into a single dataframe that can be exported as a CSV file for use in NeatMS.
#' @param fGroups The feature groups object from patRoon (default is fGroupsXCMS).
#' @param csv_path The file path where the aligned feature table CSV will be saved (default is "aligned_feature_table.csv").
#' @return A dataframe containing the aligned feature information, which is also saved as a CSV file for NeatMS.
